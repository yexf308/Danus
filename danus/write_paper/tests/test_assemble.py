"""Offline tests for danus.write_paper.assemble — embed-completeness + isolation.

Zero network / API / codex. Asserts the per-role isolation contract
(the writer embeds facts+style+structure; the auditor gets ONLY
main.tex+ledger — no facts, no style; the reviser gets no fact graph), that every
role embeds AGENTS.md verbatim, and that a missing required file raises.

Runs standalone (``python -m danus.write_paper.tests.test_assemble``) and under pytest.
