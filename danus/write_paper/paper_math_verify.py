"""Whole-paper MATH verification — helpers for the whole-document gate.

Why the gate exists. The individual facts were each verified by the verify
service before they were written to the fact graph. But the paper is a DIFFERENT
artifact: the writer re-renders and re-stitches those facts for publication —
concising, dropping "obvious" steps, adding "it suffices to…", "WLOG…" glue, and
inline reductions that were never themselves a fact. Those seams are exactly where
a correct set of facts can become an incorrect paper. So the paper must be
re-verified as written, not trusted because its facts were.

How the gate works (``server.paper_verify_math``): the WHOLE document body is sent
as ONE input to a dedicated paper-math verifier codex (a fresh one-shot run — no
resident service, no fact graph, no slicing). The verifier reads the development
in order and judges self-containedness + correctness; a paper that leans on an
unproved lemma or undefined notation fails, correctly — the paper, not the
verifier, has to be complete. A body over ``whole_doc_budget`` is recorded
``too_large`` (an honest blocker): decomposing it by results into self-contained
parts — each culminating in a designated result — is the MAIN AGENT's job (see
the write-paper skill), never a hardcoded split here. A ``wrong`` verdict routes
back through ``paper_revise`` (gap-fill / notes), driven by the main agent.

This module is the deterministic, offline-testable half:

  * ``document_body`` / ``whole_doc_budget`` — the whole-doc input + size cap.
  * ledger read/write helpers + the ``deliver_ok`` gate (``VERIFY_LEDGER.md``).
