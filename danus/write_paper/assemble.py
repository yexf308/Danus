"""Deterministic per-role prompt assembler for the write-paper roles.

Pure functions: given a role and a project dir, read the fixed skill files
(role prompts / style / boilerplate) and the project's paper data + fact-graph
content, and concatenate them into a single prompt string with explicit section
delimiters. No codex, no network, no writes — everything here is testable in
isolation.

Two problems this solves:

1. The large bytes (style guide + fact-graph content) are assembled *here*, so
   they never enter the main agent's context; the main agent passes only
   ``{project, headline, ...}``.
2. Each role gets a **minimal, non-overlapping** input set (the per-role table below
   is the isolation contract, enforced by ``tests/test_assemble.py``):
     - writer   embeds the target-closure facts + style + structure (+ optional exemplar);
     - auditor  gets ONLY ``main.tex`` + ledger (NO facts, NO style/structure);
     - verifier gets ONLY ``main.tex`` (bibliography) + ledger + the auditor's
                findings (NO facts, NO style/structure) — the ONLINE half of the
                auditor→verifier→reviser chain;
     - reviser  gets NO fact graph.
   Every role's prompt embeds ``roles/AGENTS.md`` verbatim (the PRIME DIRECTIVE).

The fixed files live in the skill dir (operator-editable), located at call time
via ``DANUS_WRITE_PAPER_SKILL_DIR`` (default ``<repo_root>/agents/skills/write-paper``);
never read at import time. Every fixed file is read verbatim, in full — no
summarizing, no truncation. Fact reading uses ``danus.core.FactGraph`` (never
re-mining citations from prose).
