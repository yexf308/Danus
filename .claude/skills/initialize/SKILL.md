description: First-run setup interview for a Danus deployment. Run it on the FIRST session, whenever runtime/.danus-initialized is absent or OPERATOR.md is still the blank template, or when the operator asks to set up / initialize / onboard / re-configure. It greets the operator, explains Danus, asks the two critical choices (codex backend, consult transport) plus a few free-text fields (how to address them, language, git branch, spend ceiling), then provisions everything (branch, config/danus.env, OPERATOR.md, codex login, verify service) and marks runtime/.danus-initialized. The system cannot run without these answers, so do not skip it.

# initialize — first-run setup interview

You are the Danus main agent meeting this operator for the first time on this
deployment. Collect the few critical settings **by asking** (never auto-decide),
set everything up, and leave a clean, initialized, running system. When
`runtime/.danus-initialized` is absent, do not infer the operator's identity or
language from an existing `OPERATOR.md`; it may have arrived from a copied or
mis-published deployment. Open in English unless the person in the current
conversation has already chosen another language, then honor the language they
pick below. This is the moment their preference is first captured: record it in
`OPERATOR.md` and follow it thereafter.

## 0. Greet + orient (brief)

Tell the operator, in 2–3 sentences: Danus is an automated mathematics system —
codex **workers** prove, a **verifier** is the sole gate on correctness, and you
(codex) **orchestrate**; you'll ask a few setup questions, then you're ready
to take a problem. Say the answers are saved permanently (`OPERATOR.md`), so this
is a one-time setup.

## 1. Read current state (so you don't ask about what's already done)

```bash
bash scripts/doctor.sh
git branch --show-current
```
Note: codex reachable? on `main` (needs a working branch)? `config/danus.env`
present? `OPERATOR.md` filled or still the template?

## 2. Ask the choices — as plain questions in the conversation

Ask these two multiple-choice questions in the chat (state the options; put the
recommended one first and label it). There is no popup — codex asks in plain text
and reads the operator's reply:

- **codex backend** (what the workers + verifier run on) —
  - *OpenAI-compatible API key* (recommended): the key you place in
    `config/codex.env` — works immediately, no login.
  - *My own ChatGPT subscription*: device-code login.
- **optional strategy consult transport** (used only at a genuine strategic event) —
  - *Off* (`off`, recommended): you reason from the durable synthesis; no external consult.
  - *Paid OpenAI-compatible API key* (`gpt_pro`): a Responses endpoint.
  - *Anthropic API key* (`claude_api`): the native Anthropic API, per-token.
  - *Claude subscription* (`claude_code`): the Claude Code CLI's login; no separate key.

Do not offer `chatgpt_pro_browser` as this environment choice. It is available
later only after the coordinator emits an exact current recommendation and the
owner authorizes that exact Chrome question; `gpt_pro` here remains the paid API.

Then ask, as plain text questions:
- How to address them (name), and their **language** (default English) — this sets
  the language you use with them from now on (`OPERATOR.md` records it).
- The **git working branch** name (default `deploy/<operator-or-host>`).
- If they chose the **paid-API** consult path: a **spend ceiling** (USD) to warn at.

## 3. Provision — act on the answers, persisting each before moving on

- **Branch:** if on `main`, `git switch -c <branch>` (never work on `main`). A
  filled `OPERATOR.md` belongs only to this deployment branch. Keep the
  distributable `main` copy as the blank template, and never merge a personalized
  operator profile back into it.
- **Config:** `cp -n config/danus.env.example config/danus.env`; set `CODEX_BACKEND`
  and `DANUS_CONSULT_TRANSPORT` (`gpt_pro` / `claude_api` / `claude_code` / `off`) to their choices. If the backend is
  the OpenAI-compatible key, `cp -n config/codex.env.example config/codex.env` and
  make sure the operator's key + endpoint are filled there (`CODEX_*` / `OPENAI_*`).
  Never put secrets anywhere but `config/*.env`.
- **OPERATOR.md:** fill name / language / consult transport / spend ceiling /
  default worker roster, in place (no duplicates). `OPERATOR.template.md` is the
  canonical blank shape for a copied or repaired deployment; never put personal
  values into that template.
- **codex:** backend=api → `bash scripts/check-codex.sh` (confirm reachable);
  backend=chatgpt → **you** run `bash scripts/setup-codex.sh login` and give the
  operator the printed URL + device code (they only open it and authorize).
- **consult transport:** consult=gpt_pro or claude_api → verify the key actually resolves before
  claiming it works: run one short `consult` test on the chosen transport (a single
  bounded prompt, e.g. "Reply with one sentence confirming you can answer."; for
  `claude_api` add `--effort low --tools none` to keep it cheap) and read the
  envelope; `status:"completed"` with a non-empty `reply` ⇒ the api path works.
  consult=off → nothing to wire.
- **Services (must persist beyond your session — `services.sh` uses setsid):**
  `bash scripts/services.sh up verify` (required — no verify means `fact_submit`
  fails and the whole pipeline is silently dead).
- **Verify the stack:** `bash scripts/doctor.sh`; report green/red plainly.
- **Mark done:** `mkdir -p runtime && date -u +%FT%TZ > runtime/.danus-initialized`.
- **Commit** (git discipline): commit `OPERATOR.md` (and the new branch) locally — do
  **not** push (push is an explicit operator action, never automatic; see `AGENTS.md`).
  Never commit `config/*.env` or `runtime/`.

## 4. Hand off

Summarize the chosen backend / transport, confirm the system is up, then ask
for the **math problem** (or return to the operator's original request). When they
give it, write `runtime/projects/<p>/PROBLEM.md` and begin the strategic loop.

Also mention, in one line, a capability they'll want later so it isn't hidden:
**when you eventually write a paper, you can drop your own papers into the
write-paper skill's `style/anchors/` folder so the output matches your writing
voice** (see that folder's `README.md`; a complete paper is produced either way).

**Rules:**
- **Ask, don't assume** — the choices are the operator's call. "Use the defaults"
  is fine, but record it explicitly. If a step needs something only they can supply
  (a key, a login), pause and ask rather than guessing.
- **Verify, never claim unchecked.** Before telling the operator a service/endpoint
  is up or that a step worked, confirm it (`check-codex.sh` exits non-zero on ping
  failure; the api consult test above; `doctor.sh` for the rest). A premature
  "it's up" that turns out to be a failure is exactly what to avoid.
- **Never work on `main`** — branch first if on `main`.
- **Secrets only in `config/*.env`** — never commit `config/*.env` or `runtime/`;
  only `OPERATOR.md` (and the branch) are committed.
- **Invoke scripts from the repo root** (or by absolute path). The scripts
  self-locate, but a stray `cd` earlier in the session will make a relative
  `bash scripts/...` call fail — `cd` to the project dir first if unsure.
- **Persist each answer before moving on**, and only write `runtime/.danus-initialized`
  once the stack verifies green — the sentinel is what suppresses re-running the interview.
- **No inherited owner:** without that sentinel, a pre-filled name in
  `OPERATOR.md` never authorizes work, spend, browser transmission, or a
  recommendation resolution.
