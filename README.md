Danus orchestrates mathematical reasoning agents with fact-graph memory. A main
agent (Claude Code) steers a swarm of autonomous codex workers that prove; a
cold-start verifier is the sole authority on correctness. A `correct` verdict is
necessary, and the gateway then atomically rechecks the verified context and adds
the fact; a stale or unavailable snapshot returns a write error instead. Verified results accumulate in a content-addressed fact
graph — the system's only source of truth — and a strategy loop (a strong
reasoning model) decomposes the problem and steers the swarm. When you have the
answer, Danus renders it into a human report or a publishable LaTeX paper.

Danus builds on the worker–verifier core of our earlier system
[Rethlas](https://github.com/frenzymath/Rethlas)
([arXiv:2604.03789](https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.03789)). The
[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.06447) and the
[technical report](https://frenzymath.com/blog/danus/) tell the full story:
the system, six research-level case studies it resolved, and what we learned
along the way.

See `ARCHITECTURE.md` for the layered design and the map of every module.

## How it works

<p align="center"><img src="docs/assets/architecture.png" width="820" alt="Danus architecture: a main agent orchestrates a worker swarm; a stateless verifier gates every fact; global memory and the fact graph are the shared storage"></p>

The design follows a strict separation of powers: the main agent performs the
global planning and coordination, the workers carry out the detailed proof
search, the verifier is the sole authority on correctness, and the fact graph
holds every verified result and is the system's only source of truth.

For large graphs, agents do not inject the graph wholesale. They discover facts
through full-text search that returns statement-only summaries, then hydrate only
explicit ids. Verification carries full cards only for direct predecessors, all
inherited fact-local and immutable global definitions, and a digest/count
commitment to the machine-checked full dependency closure. Ancestor statements,
proofs, and the edge skeleton stay out of the model prompt, and the verifier never
reads project fact files directly.
The mutable project glossary is a discovery index only; it is never injected as
an implicit verifier premise.

Each kind of agent carries out its role through its own skills and its own
role-gated set of tools, so the separation is enforced by construction, not by
prompts: the main agent has no `fact_submit` (the agent that steers the search
structurally cannot introduce unverified mathematics into the fact graph), and
the verifier writes nothing at all.

<p align="center"><img src="docs/assets/agent-tools.png" width="820" alt="The three kinds of agent, each with its own skills and its own role-gated set of tools: the main agent orchestrates and renders, the workers prove and submit, the verifier only reads"></p>

Every claim enters truth through one cycle:

<p align="center"><img src="docs/assets/verify-loop.png" width="820" alt="The submit–verify–repair cycle: a worker submits a statement and proof citing existing facts; a fresh verifier instance accepts it into the fact graph or rejects it with repair hints"></p>

A worker typically focuses on one claim at a time — a lemma, a counterexample, a
toy example — rather than an entire proof. It repeatedly submits the claim with a
supporting proof and revises it under the verifier's feedback until it passes. The
gateway then rechecks the exact context under the graph lock and, if still current,
adds the claim as a fact with the facts its proof depends on as incoming edges.
The verifier is stateless: a fresh instance
judges each submission and retains nothing afterwards. Because each worker draws
on only the facts it needs for its current claim and submits one fact at a time,
the working context stays small even as the proof grows to many pages — and many
workers' contributions accumulate into one shared structure.

The graph below is the fact graph of a real research run: **3,157 verified facts
and 8,616 dependency edges**, in dependency chains up to 54 facts deep (nodes
darken and grow with dependency depth). The search was far broader than the proof
it left behind: 664 facts form the supporting closure of the final theorem, and
the clusters are separate lines of attack — among them conditional scaffolding
that the final proof never cites, and an independent re-derivation of one of its
bounds.

## Quickstart

```bash
# 1. provision the toolchain (Node + venv + codex CLI) into runtime/
bash scripts/bootstrap.sh

# 2. configure — copy the templates and fill in YOUR keys (never committed)
cp config/danus.env.example config/danus.env
cp config/codex.env.example config/codex.env      # BYO OpenAI-compatible endpoint + key

# 3. health check + bring up the verify service (REQUIRED for any proving)
bash scripts/doctor.sh
bash scripts/services.sh up verify

# 4. connect Claude Code rooted at this repo dir; on first run it runs `initialize`.
#    --dangerously-skip-permissions lets the main agent operate autonomously (no
#    per-action permission prompts). That is the intended mode, but it means the
#    agent acts with your shell privileges — run Danus on an isolated, disposable
#    host, and read docs/security-and-trust.md first.
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

Everything runs on your own keys (BYO). Workers and the verifier run on your codex
backend; the strategy consult runs on a top-tier reasoning model over the `gpt_pro`
transport (paid), `claude_api` (the Anthropic API, per-token), or `claude_code`
(your Claude subscription), or `off` to skip it.

**Notes**

- **Settle the stopping condition with the main agent before you start.** By
  default the main agent keeps the swarm running until every target is proved and
  stops it on its own once they are (a hard or slow problem is not a reason to
  stop). Talk through what "done" means for your problem at the outset, so the swarm
  does not keep spending tokens past the point you cared about.

- **Give the writing system a few exemplar papers.** Out of the box, `write-paper`
  produces a complete, compilable paper, but the prose can read like a stack of
  verified facts. In our experience the single highest-leverage fix is to provide
  a few papers of your own as exemplars when you ask for the write-up — the writer
  imitates them, and readability improves substantially.

## Design invariants (see ARCHITECTURE.md §3)

- Three memory tiers, one correctness boundary: only the verifier-gated fact graph
  is truth; global memory is awareness.
- Permission is enforced by the MCP role table (main cannot `fact_submit`; the
  verifier is read-only).
- Content-addressed, cascade-revocable facts; a correct verdict plus the gateway's
  locked context-CAS/add is the sole write path.
- The finished paper is itself re-verified as written (a dedicated paper-math
  verifier reads the whole document) before delivery, on top of the per-fact
  verification.
