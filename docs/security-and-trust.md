# Danus — Security & Trust Model

Read this **before you rely on a Danus result** and before you deploy Danus on a
shared or networked host. It states, plainly, what you are trusting, how permission
is enforced, and where a human should stay in the loop.

## 1. The one thing to understand first: the verifier is an LLM, not a formal prover

Danus's entire notion of truth rests on the **verifier**: a result becomes a fact
**if and only if** the verifier returns a `correct` verdict. That verifier is a
**cold-start `codex` (LLM) judge**, not a formal proof assistant (no Lean/Coq/…),
and by default **there is no human in the loop.**

Consequences you must internalize:

- A `correct` verdict is a **strong LLM judgment**, not a machine-checked proof. It
  is far better than an unchecked draft, but it can be wrong.
- The mathematical findings are produced by the verifier agent. Production code
  then enforces the structural rule (`correct` ⟺ no critical errors **and** no
  gaps), rejects malformed/self-contradictory output, and requires a server-side
  context-digest attestation. These checks cannot prove the mathematics; trust
  still ultimately flows from the verifier's reasoning.
- For a **high-stakes** result (a headline theorem you intend to publish or act on),
  **have a qualified human review it.** The write-paper pipeline re-checks the whole
  paper as written through a dedicated paper-math verifier, which raises confidence —
  but it is still LLM verification, not a formal certificate.

This is the system's single most important trust assumption. It is deliberate (the
whole point is to scale proof search beyond what a formal assistant can express
today), but it is on **you** to decide how much a `correct` verdict is worth for a
given result.

## 2. Permission is enforced by construction, not by prompts

Danus does not rely on agents "behaving". Every read/write to the truth stores goes
through the **gateway** (a role-gated MCP server), and **what a role can do is
exactly which tools it can even see** — ungated tools are physically absent from an
agent's tool surface, not merely discouraged.

The role table (`danus/gateway/roles.py`):

| role | tools it can see |
|---|---|
| **worker** | `gm_add`, `gm_search`, `fact_submit`, `fact_search`, `fact_context`, `search_arxiv_theorems` |
| **main** (the orchestrator) | `gm_add`, `gm_search`, `fact_search`, `fact_context`, `fact_revoke`, `search_arxiv_theorems` — **no `fact_submit`** |
| **verifier** | `search_arxiv_theorems` **only** (read-only) |

Load-bearing separations:

- **The orchestrator can never fabricate a fact.** `main` has no `fact_submit`;
  only a `worker` can submit, and only the verifier can accept.
- **The verifier is read-only.** It can look up literature; it writes nothing to
  the truth stores.
- **Fail-closed.** An unknown, mis-typed, or *unset* role falls back to the
  most-restrictive (verifier) set, so a misconfiguration cannot grant write
  access. The full dev set requires the explicit `DANUS_ROLE=all`.

## 3. The write-gate

The single path a fact enters truth is a worker's `fact_submit`, which is a
state machine, not a suggestion:

1. lazily load full cards for the declared direct predecessors, every inherited
   fact-local definition, immutable global definitions, and a digest/count
   commitment to the core-validated transitive closure (never predecessor proofs,
   ancestor statements, the closure edge skeleton, or implicit project-glossary
   entries), and block missing, revoked, incomplete, or over-budget context;
2. call the verify service with the statement, proof, and complete authoritative
   fact context; both context and returned verdict are checked by deterministic
   schemas, not only prompts, and the service must attest the context digest;
3. after verification, rebuild the context snapshot under the graph's
   cross-process mutation lock;
4. only after a `correct` verdict and unchanged locked snapshot, attempt the fact
   add; revoke uses the same lock, closing add/revoke races, while storage errors
   remain explicit accept-but-write-failed outcomes;
5. durably attempt to trace an actual verdict to global memory (accept, reject,
   or write-failed). A trace I/O failure is returned explicitly as `trace_error`
   without hiding an already-written fact id.

If the verify service is unreachable, `fact_submit` returns a clean error and
writes nothing — nothing is silently accepted.

## 4. The verifier is read-only and ephemeral — still isolate readable secrets

The verifier uses a read-only shell sandbox, an ephemeral session, no user
config/rules, stdin prompt transport, and a schema-constrained CLI output file.
Worker execution remains separately configured and may be more permissive. Danus's
host-level safety still rests on two assumptions you must uphold:

- **The agent home is trusted.** The verifier runs inside a fixed `AGENT_HOME`
  (its contract + skills). Treat that directory — and the worker/verifier prompts and
  skills — as **trusted code**: a malicious or tampered prompt/skill could act with
  the privileges of the process.
- **The host is isolated / disposable.** A read-only Codex sandbox prevents model
  writes, not reads of every host path. Run adversarial verification and autonomous
  workers on a dedicated VM/container/pod or low-privilege account without unrelated
  readable secrets, not a workstation holding sensitive data.

## 5. Network exposure: loopback by default

The two services bind **loopback only** by default:

- **verify** on `127.0.0.1:8091`,
- **dashboard** on `127.0.0.1:8099`.

Nothing is exposed to the network out of the box. To view the dashboard remotely,
use an SSH port-forward rather than binding a public interface. (`VERIFY_HOST` /
the dashboard `--host` can change the bind, but the safe default is loopback — do
not expose these to an untrusted network.)

## 6. Secrets: bring your own key, never committed

- All credentials (codex backend key, consult key, LaTeX-git token) live **only** in
  gitignored `config/*.env` files. The tree ships `*.env.example` placeholders only —
  **no working key is committed.**
- The codex backend key is **read at run time from an environment variable**; it is
  **not** written into any config file that Danus generates (e.g. the codex
  `config.toml` references the env var name, not the value).
- Before any commit, confirm `git status` shows no `config/*.env` and no `runtime/`.

## 7. The deterministic pre-checks (a safety net, and a caveat)

Before the LLM verifier runs, the verify service applies deterministic pre-checks
that **can only reject more**, never accept more: emptiness/vacuousness checks and a
few hard prohibitions (citing the problem statement as a source, unproven
conditional premises, vague "well-known" gestures without a citation).

**Caveat:** these prohibition patterns are **tuned to specific past incidents**
and are therefore domain-specific — the single most project-flavored part of the
verifier stack. They are safe (additive); keep, generalize, or disable them to fit
your domain.

## 8. What to trust, and what to double-check

- **Trust the shape:** the permission table, the write-gate, content-addressing,
  cascade revocation, and "no fact without a `correct` verdict" are enforced in code
  and are the well-tested part of the system.
- **Double-check the verdicts** on results that matter: a `correct` verdict is an
  LLM judgment. For a publishable headline result, add a human review; the
  write-paper verify gate helps but does not replace it.
- **Treat the worker/verifier prompts + skills as trusted code**, and keep the host
  isolated.
