# Danus — Operating Guide

How to run a project end to end, from the operator's seat. You do this by **talking
to the main agent** (codex) in natural language; it runs the CLI verbs and
tools for you. Read `concepts.md` first; set up with `getting-started.md`.

> This guide describes the human workflow. Command/tool details are in
> `cli-and-tools.md`.

## The shape of a run

```
initialize ─▶ new project ─▶ strategy loop ⇄ workers prove ─▶ facts accumulate
                                   │                                 │
                            human-summary               you decide the answer
                  (progress report — any time)             → danus finalize
                                                                     ▼
                                                               write-paper
```

You stay in the loop for the judgment calls (is this the answer? push outward?
spend past the ceiling?); everything else the main agent acts on and reports.

## 0. First session — initialize

On a fresh deployment the main agent runs `initialize`: it interviews you (how to
address you + language, git branch off `main`, spend ceiling, consult transport,
codex backend), fills `OPERATOR.md` + `config/danus.env`, brings up the verify
service, and marks `runtime/.danus-initialized`. After that, every session
re-reads your `OPERATOR.md` and the project's `PROBLEM.md`.

## 1. Start a project

Tell the main agent the problem. It will:

1. **Confirm any roster override** — reasoning-first defaults to
   `max:2,high:5`: two deep workers become the fixed root and independent critic,
   with zero active explorers; five `high` workers remain dormant observers, not
   seven simultaneous paid turns and not an automatic rotation/failover pool.
   Use `--active-explorers 1|2` only for an explicit paid exploration choice;
   these stable lanes receive independent alternate routes, supporting lemmas,
   or counterexamples. Explicit legacy rejects active explorers and defaults to
   `high:3,xhigh:4`; an explicit `--roles` overrides either roster.
2. **Write `PROBLEM.md`** — your goal, verbatim, under `runtime/projects/<p>/`.
3. **Scaffold:** run
   `danus new <p> [--roles ROLE:N,...] [--active-explorers 0|1|2]`. It creates
   the workers, the empty `global_memory/` + `fact_graph/`, and a durable
   coordinator. The coordinator admits the fixed root and critic plus only the
   requested explorer lanes. A
   nonzero explorer request fails before creation if the roster is insufficient.
   Use `--coordination legacy` only as an explicit compatibility choice.

Each new terminal reasoning-first coordination slot starts a fresh app-server
thread. Only crash recovery of that same pinned slot resumes its exact thread.
The 2700-second cap applies to each paid turn, not completion of the whole
protected reasoning phase. Legacy `exec` and explicit legacy app-server
continuation are separate compatibility semantics.

A **project** is the unit of work: one problem, its own memory and fact graph. You
can run several at once; every operation names a project.

## 2. The strategy loop (steer, don't prove)

The main agent does **not** do the mathematics. It steers, periodically, on genuine
new state:

1. **Elaborate** — distill the shared stores into a high-signal synthesis (verdict,
   closed routes, dangers, the missing bridge lemmas). *(the `elaboration` skill)*
2. **Optionally consult** — `off` is the default; `gpt_pro`, `claude_api`, and
   `claude_code` are explicit opt-ins. *(the `consult` skill)*
3. **Assign** — record an actual reviewed consult reply as `master_guidance`, or
   dispatch directly from the elaboration when consult is off. Assign every
   configured protected lane (`danus assign`); for paid lanes this first stages
   the exact generation task in the coordinator, then refreshes the host
   `TASK.md` projection. Dormant observers remain unpaid.
4. **Monitor** — watch `danus status` / the dashboard; repeat when there is new
   state.

Consult and human-summary cadence is event-driven while your session is active,
not a two-hour timer. When your session is inactive, the worker processes and
their deterministic admission gate keep running, but no model-generated strategy
consult or Pro browser action starts automatically. `danus status` distinguishes
physical `live_processes`, `paid_active`, and `waiting_admission`; do not infer
model concurrency from the process count. For unattended operation see
`operations.md` (the tmux example).

As a separate late intervention, the active main agent may write one bounded
`advisor_checkpoint` only after the coordinator exposes its exact current
recommendation derived from the fixed root obstruction and independent critic
confirmation. Broad evidence that routes are blocked, dead-ended, slow,
expensive, or near exhaustion is insufficient. It may prepare that exact question
locally, then must stop for the owner's per-question authorization. This is never
a timer, unattended loop, or cost-gate action, and preparation never opens Chrome or
transmits. `chatgpt_pro_browser` is not the `gpt_pro` API. A browser import is
untrusted and cannot be guidance until the main agent reviews, synthesizes, and
records `adopt`. Adoption or `master_guidance` does not release
`owner_action_required`: audited owner-only resolution of the exact recommendation
is required before that generation can resume. The owner runs
`danus resolve-recommendation` with exact-id and paid-resume acknowledgements;
adopted guidance must link the same recommendation. Before resolving, run
`danus assign` for **every** paid lane: while this gate is open those assignments
target the next generation. Confirm `task_staging.ready=true` in
`danus status <project> --json`; the resolution then freezes that complete task
set atomically. A normal generation advance with no owner decision instead
carries the preceding frozen assignments forward byte-for-byte. Later
interventions in the
same Danus conversation retain a stable context but use a new recommendation,
prompt/request, and verified local terminal predecessor, with the exact URL
supplied by file/stdin at prepare and dispatch. Preparation still stops for a
fresh owner decision; lineage never triggers or inherits Send authority. See
`browser-advisor.md`.

If a worker crashes while a verification candidate is active and the paid
outcome cannot be reconstructed, the candidate overlay remains frozen with no
TTL. After fail-stopping/reconciling the source worker, inspect the exact receipt
in `danus status <project> --json` and use the owner-only recovery seam:

```bash
danus resolve-candidate <project> \
  --receipt <exact-candidate-receipt> \
  --outcome known-no-promotion \
  --acknowledge-paid-outcome-unknown
```

Use `known-no-promotion` only when the bound fact is absent; use
`abandon-unknown` to accept irreducible ambiguity. Both choices require
`--acknowledge-paid-outcome-unknown`, preserve the
unknown paid outcome and audit whether the fact was active at resolution. They
never call the verifier or infer success from elapsed time.

## 3. Workers prove; facts accumulate

`danus start <p>` launches the autonomous worker loops. Each worker reads its
`TASK.md` + `master_guidance`, picks proving skills, works, and submits results via
`fact_submit` — which the **verifier** gates. For reasoning-first paid work, the
coordinator's generation/slot task snapshot is authoritative; the
model-workspace `TASK.md` is materialized from those hash-attested bytes, not
from a later host edit. A submission with a glossary definition already known to
conflict is rejected by a read-only preflight before candidate admission or paid
verification. The gateway still repeats the glossary and context checks under
the promotion lock because a definition can race after preflight. A submission
becomes a **fact** only after a `correct` verdict *and* successful graph promotion
(`promoted: true` with a non-null `fact_id`); every verifier verdict is traced to
global memory either way.

If the operator wants to send morale support such as “keep going” or “believe in
yourself” to a turn that is already running, use the separate current-turn-only
channel:

```bash
danus encourage <project>/<worker> --text 'Keep going; trust your careful reasoning.'
```

This is an optional human input, not an automatic cadence or a claimed causal
intervention. It requires an authoritatively live worker and the canonical
`started` paid intent, binds the exact thread and turn, and fails instead of
queueing if that turn changes. It opens no paid turn and carries no task,
coordination, mathematical evidence, fact, or verification authority.

Monitor with:

```bash
danus status <p>                          # per-worker liveness + round + last fact id
bash scripts/services.sh up dashboard <p> # then port-forward :8099 for a visual view
```

You never hand-edit the truth stores and never write facts yourself — the fact
graph is the single verifier-gated source of truth.

## 4. Decide the answer — `danus finalize`

Danus does **not** declare a problem "done" on its own; that is a mathematical
judgment it surfaces to **you**. When the main agent judges every target proved and
the route credible, it **stops the swarm's exploration immediately** (to save
compute — `danus start` resumes it if you disagree), then says so and asks you to
confirm the answer. On your yes:

```bash
danus finalize <project> <fact_id> [<fact_id> …]
```

This records the approved target theorem(s) in `TARGET.md` (what write-paper reads).
`danus finalize <project>` with **no id** prints candidate terminal facts as
suggestions. `finalize` itself only records — the swarm was already stopped above
(on judged completion); `finalize` does not touch the workers.

## 5. Render the output

Two renderers read the verified fact graph:

**Human progress report** — `human-summary` (the `summary_write` tool): a clean,
id-free PDF for you or the mathematician who posed the problem — precise problem
statement, the essential partial results with real proof sketches, the main
obstacle, a neutral timeline, and the remaining lemma. Run it at **any time** to
see where things stand; it is not gated on finalize.

**Publishable paper** — `write-paper`: turns the target's verified facts into a
standalone `amsart` `.tex` with a real bibliography, compiled to PDF. This is the
terminal output: it requires the finalized target (step 4) and refuses to write
without one.

- Entering write-paper does **not** auto-stop the swarm — a **partial**
  result can be written up while the swarm keeps exploring the rest; the main agent
  **asks you** whether to stop exploration first.
- A project can hold **multiple papers** (one theorem each, or several theorems per
  paper) via a `paper_id`; the default paper uses the legacy `<project>/paper/`
  workspace.
- The pipeline drafts, compiles (a hard gate), audits + verifies citations online,
  and re-verifies the whole paper as written through a dedicated paper-math
  verifier before delivery. See the write-paper skill README
  (`.claude/skills/write-paper/README.md`).

## 6. Anything that leaves the machine is your call

Pushing a paper to arXiv / a LaTeX-git repo, revoking a verified fact (it cascades),
and spend past your ceiling are **operator forks**: the main agent confirms with you
before acting, then records the decision.

## Running multiple projects / staying honest

- Run several projects at once; each names its project in every operation.
- The main agent states only what it verified (it saw the fact land, checked the
  exit status) and reports errors/empties plainly — it will not silently retry and
  claim success. If it is unsure, it says so.
