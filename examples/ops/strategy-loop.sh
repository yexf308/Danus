# strategy-loop.sh <project> — the ONE parameterized strategic-cadence loop.
#
# Mechanizes the CADENCE of a strategic consult, nothing more. Each beat it
# calls the consult CLI (bin/consult) on the project's current elaboration and
# writes the reply to a file. It deliberately does NOT record master_guidance
# or dispatch workers: the elaborate -> consult -> record-master_guidance
# -> dispatch chain is owned by the resident codex main agent and its
# `elaboration` / `consult` skills (recording is a gm_add through the
# gateway, which keeps the global-memory kinds + role gating intact). This shell
# only provides the unattended timing + the raw consult call around that.
#
# Consult on NEW STATE, not a blind timer — a real deployment lets the main
# agent decide when to consult (a worker finished a round, a new dead end, the
# swarm is stuck). This loop is a simple fixed-beat stand-in for that cadence.
#
#   bash examples/ops/strategy-loop.sh <project>
#   touch runtime/projects/<project>/.strategy.stop   # graceful stop (at next beat)
#
# Env:
#   DANUS_STRATEGY_BEAT   seconds between example loop iterations (default
#                         7200 = ~2h; not production authorization to consult)
#   DANUS_CONSULT_TRANSPORT   off | gpt_pro | claude_api | claude_code (default off)
