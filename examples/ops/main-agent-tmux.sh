# main-agent-tmux.sh — run codex as a resident main agent inside tmux.
#
# This is the ONLY unattended mode in Danus: a long-lived codex session in the
# repo root. Because it starts in DANUS_ROOT it inherits the repo's AGENTS.md, its
# skills (.agents/skills), and .codex/config.toml — and .codex/config.toml is what
# wires the gateway MCP server (`python -m danus.gateway` via bin/danus-mcp). This
# script deliberately does NOT wire MCP itself; it only launches `codex` in the
# right directory. Strategic judgment, including whether to consult and what to
# dispatch, lives in that main agent and its skills, not here.
#
#   bash examples/ops/main-agent-tmux.sh
#   tmux attach -t danus-main     # to watch / interact
#
# Requires: tmux, and the `codex` CLI on PATH (bin/codex is on PATH via env.sh).
