name: verify-proof
description: Verify a result and, on acceptance, attempt its locked fact-graph write via fact_submit. Use for the full target theorem AND for every sharply-delimited intermediate result, lemma, construction, or formula you intend to build on. The verifier is the sole authority on mathematical correctness.

# Verify Proof

The verifier is the **canonical and sole authority on mathematical correctness**.
Mathematics requires 100% accuracy; even though this verifier is not a formal
proof assistant, it is the strongest correctness check in the system. No LLM
consultation, panel, or self-critique substitutes for it.

**You verify and write a fact through one tool: `fact_submit`.** It runs the
glossary-coverage check, calls the verifier, and, after acceptance, attempts a
locked context-CAS/add. A stale context returns `write_error` without a write;
there is no other way a fact enters the graph.

## When to submit

- **The full target theorem** — when you have assembled a complete proof of the
  whole problem (as a self-contained statement + proof, citing its predecessors by
  `fact_id`).
- **Every intermediate result you intend to USE downstream** — a lemma, a
  candidate construction, an arithmetic/closed-form claim, a saturation or
  local-to-global claim, any sharply-delimited step. **Adopting an unverified
  partial result as a building block is the single biggest correctness risk.** When
  in doubt, submit.

Do **not** build on an unverified finding from global memory. A `conclusion` /
`example` / `counterexample` there is awareness, not a brick — re-derive it as a
self-contained statement+proof and submit it before relying on it.

## Before you submit — write an "ugly-proof" fact

A fact in the fact graph is written in **"ugly-but-rigorous"** form (the operator
may call it an **"ugly-proof"**). The one goal of
this form is that the fact is **mechanically checkable for correctness** by a
reader with no memory and no math intuition (an agent with no recall, a human, the
verifier). It is allowed — encouraged — to be **ugly**: redundant, machine-flavored,
verbose. It is **not allowed** to be ambiguous, vague, or context-dependent.
"Ugly" is the deliberate contrast with the polished arXiv paper (a separate
pipeline); here, only mechanical correctness matters.

Concretely, before you submit:

- **Self-contained.** A reader using only this fact + its declared predecessors
  can decide whether the math is correct. The project glossary helps discover a
  definition source but is not itself an uncited premise. No appeal to chart
  positions, parse status, project history, or "as we know".
- **Define every symbol.** Each symbol used in the statement/proof is defined: in
  this fact's `glossary_introduces`, in a cited predecessor's glossary, or in the
  **global glossary** of universal notation (Z, Q, R,
  C, floor/ceil, gcd/lcm, intervals, Greek parameter names). Don't redefine
  universal notation — `glossary_introduces` is for project-specific symbols only.
  Reuse the project's existing symbol for the same object and cite a direct
  active fact that introduced its exact project definition. The project glossary
  is discovery-only and is not sent as an implicit verifier premise;
  `undefined_symbols` is an advisory coverage warning, not a correctness gate.
- **Cite every dependency by `fact_id`** — never "by the result above", never the
  problem statement as a math source.
- **Every quantifier explicit; every introduced parameter (epsilon, k, …) carries
  an explicit range.**
- **No handwave** ("obviously", "easy to see", "routine", "analogously",
  "by some classical argument") and **no chart-position references** ("as above").
- **Avoid duplicates.** Use `fact_search` for full-text discovery with statement-only results and
  `fact_context` for explicit relevant ids; search global memory with `gm_search`.
  If a verified fact already has the needed statement, cite its `fact_id` instead
  of re-proving it.

## Submit and repair

Call `fact_submit(statement, proof, predecessors=[...], glossary_introduces={...})`.
Read the result:

- `accepted: true, fact_id` — the fact is written. **Cite `fact_id`** downstream.
- `accepted: false, repair_hints` (+ `undefined_symbols`) — revise: resolve
  critical errors first, then all remaining gaps; do not assume the fix is local —
  change strategy or backtrack if needed; then resubmit. Treat any `wrong` verdict,
  any critical error, or any gap as failure.
- `verdict: "error"` — the verify service was unavailable; retry.
- `accepted: true, write_error` (e.g. a predecessor was revoked) — the fact was not
  written; re-prove or avoid that predecessor.

Every outcome is auto-logged to global memory (kind `verification`), so the
feedback is shared — `gm_search` it to learn from others' rejections.

## The verifier is the only correctness authority

If your own reasoning, the main agent's `master_guidance`, or any other LLM calls
a result correct but `fact_submit` rejects it, the verifier wins. Always. Note the
disagreement (a `dead_end` finding) and treat the "looks correct" opinion as the
unreliable signal it was. A non-verifier opinion (including `master_guidance`) is
for ideas and directions, never for correctness.

## Tools

- `fact_submit` (the only path to verify a result and write a fact)
- `fact_search` (full-text discovery returning statement summaries before proving)
- `fact_context` (explicit-id statements/definitions/edges; proofs only when
  intentionally requested for inspection)
- `gm_search` (read others' findings and verification outcomes)
